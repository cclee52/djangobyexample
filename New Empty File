This class-based view is analogous to the previous post_list view. In the
preceding code, you are telling ListView to do the following things:
• Use a specific QuerySet instead of retrieving all objects. Instead of defining
	a queryset attribute, you could have specified model = Post and Django
	would have built the generic Post.objects.all() QuerySet for you.
• Use the context variable posts for the query results. The default variable is
	object_list if you don't specify any context_object_name .
• Paginate the result, displaying three objects per page.
• Use a custom template to render the page. If you don't set a default template,
	ListView will use blog/post_list.html .



You can see a list of validation errors by accessing form.errors .
